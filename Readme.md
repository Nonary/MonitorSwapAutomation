# README

This script automates the process of switching your primary monitor with a dummy monitor using MultiMonitorTool. 
This is useful for users of Sunshine (a screen sharing software) who experience issues with sharing their primary monitor.

## CAVEATS

- If you are using Windows 11, you need to set your default terminal to "Windows Console Host". Windows Terminal is currently bugged and does not respect hiding PowerShell scripts.
- Once installing this script, you cannot move this folder as it will break the automation. If you need to move the folder, simply uninstall and install the script again.

## REQUIREMENTS

### For GFE users

- This script no longer supports GFE, but you can retrieve a legacy version of this script by downloading this release: <url_pending>

### For Sunshine users
- Version 0.19.1 or higher
- Host must be Windows
- Sunshine must be installed as a service (it does not work with the zip version of Sunshine)
- Sunshine logging level must be set to Debug
- Users must have read permissions to `%WINDIR%/Temp/Sunshine.log` (do not change other permissions, just make sure Users have at least read permissions)

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Open up MultiMonitorTool and click on `File -> Save Monitors Configuration` and save it in the current folder this script is located in with the name of `primary.cfg`.
2. Repeat the same steps of step 1, except save it with the name of `dummy.cfg`.
3. Open up the `dummy.cfg` file and set every parameter related to your primary monitor's position, refresh rate, etc. to `0`. For example:

        Name=\\.\DISPLAY1
        MonitorID=MONITOR\GSMC0C8\{4d36e96e-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0009
        SerialNumber=LGTV
        BitsPerPixel=0
        Width=0
        Height=0
        DisplayFlags=0
        DisplayFrequency=0
        DisplayOrientation=0
        PositionX=0
        
        Name=\\.\DISPLAY11
        MonitorID=MONITOR\XMD29831\{4d36e96e-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0007
        SerialNumber=DUMMY
        BitsPerPixel=32
        Width=3840
        Height=2160
        DisplayFlags=0
        DisplayFrequency=120
        DisplayOrientation=0
        PositionX=0

    In the example above, every numerical value has been set to 0, which lets the script know that the display should be turned off.
    Also take note in the example, that my dummy display should have values configured to let it know that it should be turned on.

4. Verify that in both `primary.cfg` and `dummy.cfg` that only **one** display contains values for the `BitsPerPixel`, `Width`, `Height`, and so on.
5. Basically, primary will "zero out" the dummy plug, and dummy will "zero out" the main display. The reason is so that the windows transfer back automatically to the other screen when swapping profiles.
6. In the `MonitorSwap-Dummy.ps1` file, locate your primary `MonitorId` and copy and paste it to the `primaryMonitorId` key in the settings.json file. 
    For example:
    ```
    {
    "gracePeriod": 60,
    "configSaveLocation": "%TEMP%",
    "primaryMonitorId": "MONITOR\\GSMC0C8\\{4d36e96e-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\0009"
    }
    ```

    Please make sure to escape the back slashes, as single slashes will not work in JSON.

7. Install the script by right-clicking the `Install_as_Precommand.ps1` and selecting "Run with PowerShell".
8. You will be prompted for administrator rights, as modifying Sunshine configuration will require admin rights in the coming future.
9. Verify that the sunshine.conf file is configured properly, if successful the global_prep_cmd should look like this
    global_prep_cmd = [{"do":"powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -file \"{PATH_TO_FOLDER}\\MonitorSwap-Dummy.ps1\"","elevated":"false","undo":"powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -command \"New-Item $env:TEMP/stream_ended.txt\""}]

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If you encounter issues with the script, you can try the following:

- Check that your primary monitor `MonitorId` matches the value in the `primaryMonitorId` variable in the `settings.json` file.
- Check that you have escaped the backslashes in the primaryMonitor in the `settings.json` file.
  Valid: MONITOR\\\\GSMC0C8\\\\{4d36e96e-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\\\0009

  Invalid: MONITOR\GSMC0C8\{4d36e96e-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0009
  
- Check that you have set every parameter related to the primary monitor's resolution in the `dummy.cfg` file to `0`.
- Check that you have set every parameter related to the dummy monitor's resolution in the `primary.cfg` file to `0`.
- Check that you have at least one monitor not "zeroed out" in both the primary.cfg and dummy.cfg files.
- Ensure that you have followed the requirements for Sunshine users as listed above.
- If you are still experiencing issues, try Install_as_Precommand.ps1 again.
